# Changelog

All notable changes to PaperPull are recorded here. Versioning follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org):

- **PATCH** — bug fixes, or repairing an app after a provider changes its site
- **MINOR** — a new app, or a cross-app feature
- **MAJOR** — breaking changes (repo layout, config format, removing an app)

## [0.6.1] — 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- **`setup-all.bat` never installed the shared core, so a fresh Windows clone
  produced fourteen virtual environments that all failed at startup with
  `ModuleNotFoundError: paperpull_core`.** Every app has imported the core
  since 0.5.0, and each app's own `setup.bat` was updated to install it; the
  one-shot script was missed. `setup-all.command` on macOS was unaffected, so
  Windows was the broken path. It installs the core from `core/` in a repo
  checkout and falls back to the bundled wheel in a standalone copy.
- `setup-all.bat` downloaded Playwright's Chromium once per app. It is a
  single shared install, so thirteen of the fourteen downloads were redundant
  — and it is by far the slowest step.
- `setup-all.bat` reported "All set - 9 apps" regardless of how many it had
  set up; the count was hardcoded when there were nine. It counts now.
- The failure summary in `setup-all.bat` began `echo !!`, and `!` is the
  delayed-expansion escape, so `cmd` consumed the marker *and* the list of
  failed apps with it — the one line that says what went wrong printed as a
  bare `FAILED`.

### Changed
- Both `setup-all` scripts reuse an existing virtual environment instead of
  rebuilding it. Rebuilding one that is in use fails with a permission error,
  which is exactly the situation in which someone re-runs setup.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-18

### Added
- **UKG Pro / UltiPro — pay statements (14th provider), and a new category:
  payroll.** UKG is the first provider without a fixed address: every employer
  runs its own tenant, so the site is read from `base_url` in `config.json`
  rather than hardcoded — which also keeps it out of the repo, since a tenant
  address identifies the employer. Sign-in varies too (a UKG username and
  password, or corporate SSO with MFA); neither involves the tool.

  Statements and PDFs both come from the JSON API that UKG's own mobile app
  uses, over the ordinary session, so **on a site that can also change direct
  deposit and tax withholding this app never activates a control at all.** It
  additionally refuses any URL whose path says `EDIT` rather than `VIEW`,
  which is how UKG Pro itself separates the two.

  W-2s and other tax forms are *not* fetched yet; the routing and rules for
  them are in place, so adding them is a change to `ukg_site.py` alone.

### Fixed
- A first run with no `config.json` died with a `FileNotFoundError` traceback.
  It now names the file, gives the copy command for the platform, and explains
  why the file is not shipped. Malformed JSON reports the syntax error, and a
  config saved from Notepad with a BOM now loads. This is every app's first
  run, not just the new one.
- **UKG:** two pay runs sharing a date (a regular and an off-cycle) collapsed
  into one record, silently losing a statement. Repeated dates are now
  disambiguated by document number.
- **UKG:** the tenant guard compared URLs with a string prefix, so
  `https://tenant.example.com.evil.test/` and
  `https://tenant.example.com@evil.test/` both passed it. It now parses the
  URL and compares scheme, host and port, and rejects embedded credentials.

### Changed
- **UKG:** records store the API path rather than the full URL, so the
  employer's tenant address no longer reaches `discovery.json`,
  `progress.json` or the index CSV.
- The provider tables no longer claim UKG downloads W-2s, which it does not.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-17

### Added
- **macOS and Linux support.** Every app ships a `.command` launcher beside
  each `.bat`, with the same names and behaviour, plus `setup-all.command` and
  `gui/run_gui.command`. Browser discovery is platform-aware: Playwright keeps
  Chromium under `LOCALAPPDATA` on Windows, `~/Library/Caches` on macOS (inside
  `Chromium.app`) and `~/.cache` on Linux, and the Edge/Chrome lookup that two
  bot-protected providers rely on knows where those live on each OS.
- **`paperpull-core`** — the support code the apps used to duplicate now lives
  once in `core/`. An app declares an `AppSpec` (its folders, routing, CSV
  columns and config defaults) and keeps only its orchestrator and `*_site.py`.
  About 15,400 duplicated lines became a 1,500-line core plus short
  declarations, so a fix lands once instead of thirteen times.
- **`tools/check_installs.py`** reports whether standalone installs have
  drifted from the repo. It reads only code — never config, state, CSVs, PDFs
  or browser profiles.

### Fixed
- AES-encrypted PDFs failed validation because pypdf needs its optional crypto
  extra; some providers issue them. Depending on `pypdf[crypto]` fixes it
  everywhere at once.
- Browser discovery picked the *oldest* installed Playwright Chromium, and
  sorted lexicographically so `chromium-1000` ranked below `chromium-999`.
  Newest build now wins.
- The macOS launchers referred users to `.bat` files, and their banner text was
  interpolated into double quotes — mangling output, and executing anything
  shaped like `$(...)` had a `.bat` ever contained it. Banners are now properly
  single-quoted.
- `setup-all.command` used an empty-array expansion that errors under `set -u`
  on the bash 3.2 macOS still ships.
- Running a launcher before setup gave a bare "No such file or directory"; it
  now names the script to run.

### Changed
- `SECURITY.md` and the README described the read-only guard as a blocklist
  **and** an allowlist for every app. That is true of the nine statement apps,
  which refuse any control not on the allowlist; the three receipt apps have no
  allowlist and screen a narrow print/invoice pattern against the blocklist,
  and Gap clicks nothing at all. Both documents now say what each app actually
  enforces.
- Test fixtures and code comments no longer carry real order numbers or a real
  carrier tracking number; they use same-shaped fakes.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- **Gap** — in-store purchases are now separated from online orders. Gap's
  history page mixes the two; they were all being typed "Online" and filed in
  `Online\`. There is now an `In-Store\` folder (matching the Target and
  Walmart apps), online orders record the Gap Inc. brand that shipped them,
  in-store purchases record the store, and `--online` / `--instore` run one
  kind. Also fixes card-boundary detection: card text was bounded by length,
  so on an account whose cards are sparse the walk captured the whole list and
  every purchase inherited the first card's date. A card now ends at the first
  sibling order id.

### Changed
- **Gap** gained `run_online.bat` / `run_instore.bat`, matching Target and
  Walmart.
- **Amazon** drops the same dead invoice branch as Gap: `_handle_no_receipt`
  was never called, so the `Invoices\` folder and the `include_invoices` knob
  it depended on could never be reached. What Amazon saves is unchanged — its
  printable order summary is captured as the receipt, as it always was.
- **Every app** now creates only the document folders it can actually fill.
  Each app was cloned from the nearest existing one and inherited that app's
  whole folder list, so installs grew permanently-empty folders — `Insurance
  Documents` (real only for USAA, which is also an insurer), `Other Documents`
  (never a configurable document type), and `Invoices` (reachable only in the
  Target and Walmart apps). Routing is unchanged and now creates a folder on
  demand, so a category that is reachable but rare still gets its folder the
  moment a document lands there. Nothing that holds documents is affected.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-08-16

### Added
- **Gap Inc.** — order receipts (13th provider). One Gap login covers Gap, Old
  Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and Gap Factory, and a single order history
  holds orders from all of them; the brand is recorded per order. The order
  history lazy-loads on scroll rather than paginating by year, so discovery is a
  single scrolled pass over everything Gap still exposes (about the last 13
  months). Gap ships no printable invoice and no print stylesheet, so each
  order's own details page is captured: the app waits for the page to load its
  data, hides everything outside the purchase-summary block (a display-only
  change to the local page), and renders the result with `printToPDF` — a
  receipt with the purchase header, line items and charge summary, and none of
  the site navigation.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-08-16

### Security
- **GUI control panel** now refuses any request whose `Origin`/`Referer` host is
  not localhost, closing a cross-site "trigger a run" vector on the command API
  (`/api/apps`, `/api/run`). The server already binds to `127.0.0.1` only and
  has no CORS; `SECURITY.md` now documents the localhost/CDP posture (close the
  signed-in browser when you're done — while it is open, any local process could
  attach to its debugging port).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-16

### Added
- **Verizon (Fios)** — Fios / Home Internet bill statements (10th provider).
  Uses your installed Microsoft Edge (T-Mobile-style bot protection blocks the
  bundled Chromium) and captures downloads via a controlled directory over CDP.
- **T-Mobile** — monthly bill statements (11th provider). Reads the bill-history
  page and downloads each period's detailed-bill PDF via a real download event.
- **Target RedCard / Target Circle Card** — monthly billing statements (12th
  provider). The RedCard credit account is serviced by TD Bank USA; reads the
  statements table (per-year switcher) at mytargetcirclecard.target.com and
  downloads each row's statement PDF via a real download event.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-15

First tagged release.

### Apps (9 providers)
- **Amazon** — order invoices, full order history
- **American Express** — statements + year-end summary
- **Dominion Energy (VA)** — billing statements
- **Navy Federal Credit Union** — account statements
- **Robinhood** — account statements + tax documents
- **Target** — receipts
- **USAA** — statements
- **Walmart** — receipts
- **Wealthfront** — statements + tax documents

### Features
- Read-only, connect-to-your-browser design — you sign in yourself; the tool
  never handles credentials or bypasses 2FA
- Delete-safe skip — deleting PDFs after importing them elsewhere never causes
  a re-download
- Account-holder ("owner") tagging: a first-run prompt plus an "Account Holder"
  column in the index CSV
- Multi-account support via `--config`
- Local FastAPI **control-panel GUI** that drives every app
