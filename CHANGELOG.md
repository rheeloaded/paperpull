# Changelog

All notable changes to PaperPull are recorded here. Versioning follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org):

- **PATCH** — bug fixes, or repairing an app after a provider changes its site
- **MINOR** — a new app, or a cross-app feature
- **MAJOR** — breaking changes (repo layout, config format, removing an app)

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Verizon (Fios)** — Fios / Home Internet bill statements (10th provider).
  Uses your installed Microsoft Edge (T-Mobile-style bot protection blocks the
  bundled Chromium) and captures downloads via a controlled directory over CDP.
- **T-Mobile** — monthly bill statements (11th provider). Reads the bill-history
  page and downloads each period's detailed-bill PDF via a real download event.
- **Target RedCard / Target Circle Card** — monthly billing statements (12th
  provider). The RedCard credit account is serviced by TD Bank USA; reads the
  statements table (per-year switcher) at mytargetcirclecard.target.com and
  downloads each row's statement PDF via a real download event.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-15

First tagged release.

### Apps (9 providers)
- **Amazon** — order invoices, full order history

### Features
- Read-only, connect-to-your-browser design — you sign in yourself; the tool
  never handles credentials or bypasses 2FA
- Delete-safe skip — deleting PDFs after importing them elsewhere never causes
  a re-download
- Account-holder ("owner") tagging: a first-run prompt plus an "Account Holder"
  column in the index CSV
- Multi-account support via `--config`
- Local FastAPI **control-panel GUI** that drives every app
